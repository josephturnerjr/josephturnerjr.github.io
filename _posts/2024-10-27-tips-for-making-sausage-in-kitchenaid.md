The first couple of times I made sausage with my KitchenAid mixer
[grinder/sausage stuffer attachment](https://amzn.to/3YFLpyr)¹, 
I made mistakes. Luckily for you, I
documented those mistakes. Now they can help me (and you!) make better
sausage.

There are plenty of good text and video tutorials that cover the basics of sausage
making, with the KitchenAid and otherwise. This is not that. This is a
short list of tips that will make the process go more smoothly and
result in plumper, better sausages.

* Four hands are much, much better than two. Trying to manage feeding
  the meat into the machine while also controlling and supporting the
sausage as it fills the casing is really tough by yourself. Having one
person feed while the other supports goes much more smoothly.
* Chilling the equipment is time consuming. Do it the night before.
* Tutorials will correctly tell you to keep your meat very cold, but 
don’t over-freeze the chunks of meat. It’s very difficult for the
grinder to grind them consistently. Instead, spread the meat in as thin
a layer as you can manage, for example on a rack on a sheet pan, and let it chill
until just the outside of the meat is ice cold. In a single layer, that
takes roughly twenty to thirty minutes.
* A [4" hotel pan](https://amzn.to/3BVrQJm) or two is very handy for
  cooling meat, collecting sausages, making links, and more.
* Put everything in an ice bath: the bowl you grind into, the meat
  you're about to grind, etc. Keeping everything cold while working
means you can often do two steps without re-chilling, speeding things up
considerably.
* Use a good meat thermometer to check the temperature of the output to
  know if you need to re-chill or not. You're aiming for near-freezing,
ideally just below freezing (32F, 0C).
* 5 pounds of meat is the MAXIMUM you want to use when emulsifying using the
KitchenAid with the paddle attachment. Even 3 pounds threatens to overflow
at the slowest speed once the meat begins to come together.
* Differing diameters of the casings result in very different results and
require very different techniques: a smaller casing struggled to come
off the horn and wanted to split, while a larger one came off easily and
thus wanted to be underpacked. Observe your casings as you put them on
the horn and adjust appropriately.
* When stuffing, use smaller bits of emulsified meat at a time, particularly 
if it's very cold. Otherwise the push
stick gets stuck in the tube and has to be removed with two hands.
* Tie a knot in the end of your casing, and puncture with a needle or
  other small pointy bit. This gets a very tight end on your links.
* Don't bother twisting links until the end if you're working alone.
  Stuff the entire batch of emulsified meat, then twist afterwards.
* After stuffing and linking, puncture not only to eliminate air pockets
  but also just puncture all over the casings at random. This helps
crisp the casings when cooking.
* When drying the links in the fridge, put them on a rack so that the bottoms dry as
well as the tops. Flip the sausage once during the drying time.
* I think you need to cook the links a little longer than to temp to get
the casings to crisp. Low and slow, but for quite a while. A tough
casing dispels the illusion that you're not eating intestine.

None of this is groundbreaking, and I imagine anyone who has done a few
batches themselves internalizes most of this, but I never saw any of the
tutorials I watched/read cover these points. Hopefully I can help
someone avoid these pitfalls.

¹ Philosophical point incoming. I generally think the internet is a
fantastic place for dabblers like myself. There is a wealth of
information on how to approach almost any hobby. However, I think there
is a dark side to this, especially in community sites like Reddit and
some message boards, in which people who have been doing the hobby for a
while want to dictate a minimum bar to get started.

In this case, if you read about sausage making, or watch videos
about it, or whatever, you'll see folks telling
beginners they may as well throw away their mixer attachment and save
that money for a "real" grinder and a "real" stuffer. I think this kind
of shit is toxic. As a beginner, it's fine and maybe even
encouraged, to start with a cheaper
alternative, using what is at hand or even DIYing stuff. Folks have been
making sausages by hand-stuffing meat cut with knives for a thousand
years. Any mechanical tool is an upgrade from that!
