I have started and worked at some startups. One got acquired, one got
acqui-hired, and one failed. 

I've also worked at some big companies. One
I hated, the other I rather like, though the siren song of self
employment always beckons.

But I'm not sure any of that is relevant here. I started writing this
because I want to write more, and I particularly want to write about
stuff (mostly computers stuff) that I am exploring.

So here we go!
